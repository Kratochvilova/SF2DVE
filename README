Overview

	Sf2dve is a tool transforming Stateflow diagrams into DVE,
	the native input language of DiVinE model checker
	(https://divine.fi.muni.cz/), in order to enable automated
	formal verification of the Stateflow systems. The program takes
	either MathWorks SLX file format or XML document and generates
	DVE source code to either standard output or a file.

	Because of the Stateflow format being proprietary, formal
	correctness of the transformation cannot be guaranteed.
	The algorithm is based on informal specification contained in User's
	Guide (http://www.mathworks.com/help/pdf_doc/stateflow/sf_ug.pdf)
	and on observations of Stateflow behaviour.

Supported Stateflow features:

	* states with 'entry', 'during' and 'exit' actions
	* transitions with conditions, condition actions, transition actions
	* hierarchy of the states
	* labelled default transitions
	* implicit tick event
	* variables of integer and boolean types
	* c as action language

Unsupported Stateflow features:

	* events (including 'on event' actions, transitions guarded with
	  events, event broadcasting)
	* bind actions
	* AND decomposition of states
	* connective and history junctions
	* functions, boxes
	* variables of float types
	* MATLAB as action language

Dependencies:

	Sf2dve is written in python3 and uses libraries lxml a ply.
	Following fedora or debian packages are required for running sf2dve:
		* python3 (version >=3.2)
		* python3-lxml
		* python3-ply

Usage examples:

	python3 sf2dve.py lift.xml lift.dve

	Full usage: python3 sf2dve.py --help

Testing sf2dve:

	The program is also able to generate an additional process for
	testing correctness of the transformation. Variables with the scope
	'input' are then nondeterministically assigned random numbers.

This tool was created as part of a bachelor's thesis on Masaryk
University Faculty of Informatics, Brno.
